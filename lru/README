This is the readme for a the lru.py demo program, provided upon request for 
BrandVerity.

This program was written and tested in Python2.7.9, and requires no 
non-standard libraries. 
To use it, either cat a test input file into the program's stdin, or 
type your input directly, followed by CTRL+D. 

Each command should be on its own line. The following commands are supported:
SIZE takes one argument, and defines the size of the cache. All commands
	prior to SIZE will fail, as the cache has not yet been instantiated.
PUT takes two arguments, key and value, inserts the key/value pair into
	the cache.
GET takes one argument, retrieves the value associated with a key.
EXIT terminates the program.
